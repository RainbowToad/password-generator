# <Password Generator>

## Description

This project was done to explore my growing knowledge of Javascript by making a password generator. Some of the javascript code was already provided but the logic to create the password was up to me. I learned a lot about the importance of pseudo-code and taking things one step at a time to accomplish a goal. I had to look up a lot of syntax and explore various javascript tools. I still have many things to learn but am proud I was able to successfully complete the project.
